# Linked-Dictionary
Sophomore Year Data Structure and Algorithms Honors Project
In this project my professor tasked us with taking a normal linked list data structure and alter it to perform differently than we were initially taught. We were tasked with creating a code that would presnt a menu of options to the user to allow the entrance of words into the linked list. If a specific word was entered multiple time we wanted to increase the freuqncy of that word instead of creating a new node for the entrance. To do this I had to combine the linked list with the key-value aspect of a dictionary. This allowed the addition of a frequency value to each node that could be altered whenever a new word is added.
